**SAN FRANCISCO AUTO RENTAL ANALYSIS**
**Business Background **
San Francisco Auto Rental Company deals with providing vehicles to customer transportation for short-term or long-term.
SAR found a problem in 2013 that the drivers were not showing up for the rides they were scheduled for.The clients were left with no rides even though they booked them in advance.
This problem has been continuing since 2013, and by 2024, SAR found no proper evidence on why the drivers were cancelling the rides despite having an online booking system for scheduling rides beforehand and calling in the driver for communication. 
Furthermore, SAR company reputation and customer satisfaction of booking rides were at stake, as the root cause of the above-mentioned problem has not been addressed.
This project will study and deploy machine learning algorithms to find a predictive analytical solution to the problem. 
The dataset consists of 10000 observations with 19 attributes including information about vehicle packages, travel packages ,
geographical locations and mode of the booking channels. Analyzing the historical data on cancellations, customer booking behavior,
vehicle and package booking parameters, and contribution of geographical factors.
